# 🗺️ Project Roadmap

**Evolving from a simple bot into a decentralized, verifiable AI intelligence network.**

This roadmap outlines the journey from basic sentiment analysis to a "World Class" autonomous financial agent that owns its own intellectual property on-chain.

---

### ✅ Phase 1: The Foundation (Completed)
*The goal: Give the bot "eyes" and a "brain" to understand the market.*

- [x] **Core Interface:** Developed a responsive bot interface for seamless user interaction.
- [x] **Data Engine:** Implemented a social media scraper to fetch real-time social signals for high-velocity tokens.
- [x] **AI Analysis:** Integrated a **Transformer Model** to score content with high contextual accuracy (0.0 to 1.0).
- [x] **Data Pipeline:** Established a structured database to cache data and track user requests.

---

### ✅ Phase 2: The "Proof of Intelligence" (Completed)
*The goal: Anchor AI insights onto the blockchain as verifiable assets.*

- [x] **Blockchain Integration:** Connected the backend to a testnet environment.
- [x] **IP Minting Pipeline:** Created the logic to package AI sentiment reports (Timestamp + Score + Metadata) and register them as **IP Assets** on-chain.
- [x] **Cloud Architecture:** Deployed the Backend API and Bot Worker for 24/7 uptime.
- [x] **Smart Fallback System:** Implemented "Smart Mocking" to ensure the demo experience remains smooth even if external APIs rate-limit.

### 🚀 Phase 3: The "World Class" Upgrade (In Progress)
*The goal: Transform from an analyst into an autonomous agent.*

- [ ] **Multi-Agent "Council":**
    - Instead of one score, implement three distinct AI agents:
        1.  **The Chartist:** Analyzes price action (Technical Analysis).
        2.  **The Fundamentalist:** Reads whitepapers and news.
        3.  **The Degenerate:** Analyzes social hype.
    - *Goal:* The three agents debate and vote on a final "Confidence Score."

- [ ] **Visual PNL Scanner (OCR):**
    - Implement Computer Vision to read screenshots of PNL cards.
    - *Goal:* Verify if a "1000% Profit" screenshot is real or photoshopped by cross-referencing historical price data.

- [ ] **Automated Execution:**
    - Connect to crypto wallets.
    - *Goal:* Allow users to set triggers (e.g., "If Sentiment > 0.90, execute buy order").

---

### 💎 Phase 4: The Decentralized Intelligence Marketplace (Future)
*The goal: Monetize the AI's IP.*

- [ ] **IP Marketplace Frontend:**
    - A dashboard where users can view their minted Sentiment IP Assets.
- [ ] **Tokenized Queries:**
    - Allow users to "sell" their complex search queries to other traders.
- [ ] **Reputation Oracle:**
    - An on-chain scoring system that tracks how accurate predictions were over time.
    - *Goal:* Prove the AI's performance immutably.

### 🤝 For Contributors: How to Help
We welcome open-source contributions! Here are high-impact areas where you can help:

1.  **Add New Data Sources:**
    - We currently track limited sources. Help us add **Reddit** or **Discord** scrapers.
2.  **Improve the AI:**
    - Fine-tune the model on a newer dataset of crypto-slang.
3.  **Dockerization:**
    - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to spin up the Bot, API, and Database with a single command.
4.  **Frontend Dashboard:**
    - Build a simple web UI to visualize the sentiment trends over time.
